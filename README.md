# Real Lens: Deepfake Detection System

## Overview

**Real Lens** is an advanced deepfake detection system designed to identify manipulated media content across images, videos, and audio files. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, Real Lens provides a robust solution for detecting deepfakes with high accuracy. This project is ideal for researchers, developers, and organizations looking to safeguard against the growing threat of deepfake technology.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Real Lens offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds. The streamlined design ensures a seamless experience from media upload to result interpretation.

- **Multi-Modal Detection**: The system supports detection across three media types:
  - **Image Detection**: Utilizes a ResNet50 model to analyze images for deepfake characteristics.
  - **Video Detection**: Employs a ViT (Vision Transformer) model to scrutinize video frames for signs of manipulation.
  - **Audio Detection**: Uses a Wav2Vec2 model to evaluate audio files for synthetic alterations.

- **High Accuracy**: Real Lens is built on models with impressive accuracy rates:
  - **Video Detection**: Approximately 92.3% accurate
  - **Image Detection**: Approximately 83.8% accurate
  - **Audio Detection**: Approximately 84.2% accurate

- **Real-Time Processing**: The system processes media files quickly, providing results with confidence scores to help users make informed decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Media**: Users can upload images, videos, or audio files through the user-friendly interface.
2. **Processing**: The system processes the uploaded media using pre-trained models specific to each media type.
3. **Results**: Real Lens displays the detection results, indicating whether the media is real or fake, along with a confidence score.
